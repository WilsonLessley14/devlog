{"id":"devlog-apn","title":"Create widget component for homepage","description":"Create a generalized component widget for the home page. This widget should accept a svelte component that it will render. The widget will also have a modular layout system, that allows the same widget component to be used for many different sized widgets.\n\nThis widget component will be a wrapper that will handle the layout, and provide the svelte component with the necessary props to render itself. The component being rendered as a widget will be responsible for its own styling, and async/external requests, and should be designed to be used in a widget context.\n\nThe product goal is to have a generalized widget component that lets me show off the different endpoints that I'm creating. Currently I have a showcase widget, a cat gallery widget, a contributions widget, and a blog widget. I want to be able to use the same widget component for all of these, and be able to easily add new widgets to the home page.\n\nFile: src/routes/home/\nTags: widget, home\nOriginal ID: T011","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-30T17:47:12.649506-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-30T17:47:12.649506-05:00"}

A \"project\" in this scenario can be a github repo or sub-repo, where a readme is grabbed and parsed to extract a title, description, and image (this requires some standardization of my project readmes). The other option is showing off a game from this blogs POC games endpoint. Eventually I would like the showcase widget to include a little playable version of the game, but at first just an image, description, title and link to the games own playable page is sufficient.\n\nThe end goal is to have a showcase widget that can be used on the home page to show off a random project or game. An MVP would be a new route that shows off the described info, and uses a component to display it (with the consideration that we will later turn that component into a widget for the home page).\n\nFile: src/routes/projects/\nTags: showcase, portfolio","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-30T17:47:34.007789-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-30T17:47:34.007789-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"devlog-rj9","depends_on_id":"devlog-apn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-30T17:51:39.446735-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"devlog-rj9","depends_on_id":"devlog-lp5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-30T17:51:39.585183-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
