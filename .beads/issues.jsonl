{"id":"devlog-rj9","title":"Showcase projects","description":"I want an endpoint and widget that show off a randomly selected project. A \"project\" in this scenario can be a github repo or sub-repo, where a readme is grabbed and parsed to extract a title, description, and image (this requires some standardization of my project readmes). The other option is showing off a game from this blogs POC games endpoint. Eventually I would like the showcase widget to include a little playable version of the game, but at first just an image, description, title and link to the games own playable page is sufficient.\n\nThe end goal is to have a showcase widget that can be used on the home page to show off a random project or game. An MVP would be a new route that shows off the described info, and uses a component to display it (with the consideration that we will later turn that component into a widget for the home page).\n\nFile: src/routes/projects/\nTags: showcase, portfolio","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-30T17:47:34.007789-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-30T17:47:34.007789-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"devlog-rj9","depends_on_id":"devlog-apn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-30T17:51:39.446735-05:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"devlog-rj9","depends_on_id":"devlog-lp5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-30T17:51:39.585183-05:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"}]}

{"id":"devlog-wg3","title":"Deploy site","description":"Deploy the portfolio site to Railway for SSR hosting.\n\n## Why Railway\n- SSR support with adapter-node (same adapter works for self-hosting later)\n- No cold starts on free tier (/month credit)\n- Minimal migration work when moving to self-hosted\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### 1. Install and configure adapter-node\n```bash\nnpm install -D @sveltejs/adapter-node\n```\n\n### 2. Update svelte.config.js\n```js\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';\n\nexport default {\n  kit: {\n    adapter: adapter()\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### 3. Create Railway project\n- Connect GitHub repo to Railway\n- Railway auto-detects SvelteKit and configures build\n- Set any required environment variables (GITHUB_FINE_GRAIN_ACCESS_TOKEN)\n\n### 4. Configure production settings\n- Set up custom domain (optional)\n- Configure health checks\n- Review Railway dashboard for resource usage\n\n### 5. Verify deployment\n- Test all routes (/, /blog, /contributions, /cats, /games, /design-system)\n- Verify SSR is working (view source should show rendered HTML)\n- Test GitHub contributions feature with production token\n\n## Future Migration to Self-Hosting\nWhen ready to self-host, the same adapter-node build can be:\n- Run directly with `node build`\n- Containerized with Docker\n- Deployed to any VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.)\n\n## Environment Variables Required\n- GITHUB_FINE_GRAIN_ACCESS_TOKEN (for contributions feature)\n\n## Tags\ndeploy, production, railway, ssr, adapter-node","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-30T17:47:32.657878-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-24T11:36:31.620185-05:00"}
