# /utils

This directory is for reusable TypeScript functions and classes that are not tied to a specific feature.

**Guidelines:**

- Only include pure, side-effect-free functions and classes.
- Each utility should be JSDoc documented and unit tested.
- Prefer generic solutions over feature-specific logic.
